email_submit.py

Library for dealing with student work submissions via email.

To be used effectively, you also need a mail fetching program that can
send messages to standard output; getmail is recommended.

INTERFACES:

1) When called as 'get-submissions' this program wraps a call to your
   mail fetching program (which you must configure separately),
   setting the EMAIL_SUBMIT_DIRECTORY environment variable if it is
   not set already.

2) When called as 'split-attachments' this program reads a message
   from standard input and saves one or more attachments found in that
   message to the submit directory.  This interface is intended for
   non-interactive use (e.g., as an MDA_external destination for
   getmail).  Attachments are saved with the sender's email address
   prepended to the filename.  This associates the sender's email with
   the file, so that the file can later be sent back to the sender via
   the send-feedback interface.

3) When called as 'send-feedback' this program walks over the files in
   the submit directory and emails them back to their original senders
   (as attachments) using Python's smtplib package.  You must
   configure your connection to an SMTP server by setting
   SMTP_CONNECTION_CLASS and SMTP_ARGS in this script.
